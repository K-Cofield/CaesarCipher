# CaesarCipher
Overview
This program implements a simple Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text data. It focuses on three specific pieces of data: username, password, and IPv4 address. The encryption and decryption are achieved through a simple character shifting mechanism.

Features

Encryption: Shifts each character of the username, password, and IPv4 address by a fixed number (key) to encrypt data.

Decryption: Reverses the encryption process to retrieve original data.

File Handling: Writes encrypted data to and reads from a file named encryptedData.txt.

User Interaction: Allows the user to choose between encryption, decryption, and exiting the program.

How to Use

Compile and Run: Use a C compiler to compile the code and run the resulting executable.
Choose an Operation:

Press E to encrypt data.

Press D to decrypt data from encryptedData.txt

Press Q to quit the program.

Follow Prompts: Enter the required information (username, password, IPv4) when prompted.

Implementation Details

Encryption/Decryption Algorithm: The program uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm, shifting characters based on ASCII values.
File Operations: It employs standard file I/O functions for reading from and writing to files.

Language: Written in C.
